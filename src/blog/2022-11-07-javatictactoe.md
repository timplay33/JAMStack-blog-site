# JavaTicTacToe

Java, a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language and also the programming language used for Minecraft, one of the most popular games ever.

My first experiences with Java came from creating Modifications (short mods) for Minecraft. Even though there were multiple options for visual mod creation, I wanted to know how to do it from the roots on. 

A﻿fter creating multiple mods for Minecraft, I started to wonder how programs create their front-end. After a quick search on the internet, I had found the *javax.swing* library, which allows you to easily create a front-end to your console app.

This simple tic-tac-toe game features: 

* Showing current player 
* Calculating winner

The game's source code as well as a build can be found on my GitHub. <https://github.com/timplay33/JavaTicTacToe>

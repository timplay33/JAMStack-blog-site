# JavaTicTacToe

Java, a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language and also the programming language used for Minecraft, one of the most popular games ever.

My first experiences with Java came from creating Modifications (short mods) for Minecraft. Even though there were multiple options for visual mod creation, I wanted to know how to do it from the roots on. 

A﻿fter creating multiple mods for Minecraft I started to wonder 

A simple tic-tac-toe game written in Java. Features: 

* Show current player 
* Calculate winner

I created this game in order to learn the basics of programming in Java.

The game's source code as well as a build can be found on my GitHub. <https://github.com/timplay33/JavaTicTacToe>

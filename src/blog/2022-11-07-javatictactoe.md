# JavaTicTacToe

A simple tic-tac-toe game written in Java. Features: 
- Show current player 
- Calculate winner

I created this game in order to learn the basics of programming in Java.

The game's source code as well as a build can be found on my GitHub. [https://github.com/timplay33/JavaTicTacToe](https://github.com/timplay33/JavaTicTacToe)
